"""
Monte Carlo Tree Search in AlphaGo Zero style, which uses a policy-value
network to guide the tree search and evaluate the leaf nodes
Adapted from https://github.com/junxiaosong/AlphaZero_Gomoku

Modified by Chi-Hang Suen:
# mcts_alpha0_resuse: based on version _explore, reuse search sub-tree for evaluation mode as well
# mcts_alpha0_explore: in get_action, also add back Dirichlet noise after MCTS search 
#            (in addition to Dirichlet noise inside MCTS search), add such explore config
# mcts_alpha0_refill: expand and refill with noise for root if self-play; 
#                    rename input state as board for _playout & get_move_probs to align terminology in game module
# mcts_alpha0: remove unnecessary steps in expand & by moving network evaluation to after checking end game or not
Fix bug in Dirichlet noise implementation in: MCTS_player & MCTS __init__, TreeNode expand, MCTS _playout, MCTS_player get_action.
Align with paper, set temperature as 1 for early moves during self-play: MCTS_player get_action
